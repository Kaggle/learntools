    "**[Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)** is a game where two players alternate turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. Each player uses a different color (usually red or yellow), and the objective of the game is to be the first player to get four discs in a row. \n",

    "- In the first lesson, you'll learn how to set up the game environment and create your first agent.\n",
    "- The next two lessons focus on traditional methods for building game AI.  These agents will be smart enough to defeat many novice players!\n",
    "- In the final lesson, you'll experiment with cutting-edge algorithms from the field of reinforcement learning.  The agents that you build will come up with gameplay strategies much like humans do: gradually, and with experience. \n",
