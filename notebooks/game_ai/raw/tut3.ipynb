    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, you learned how to build an agent with one-step lookahead.  This agent performs reasonably well, but definitely still has room for improvement!  For instance, consider the potential moves in the figure below.  (_Note that we use zero-based numbering for the columns, so the leftmost column corresponds to `col=0`, the next column corresponds to `col=1`, and so on._)\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "With one-step lookahead, the red player picks one of column 5 or 6, each with 50% probability.  But, column 5 is clearly a bad move, as it lets the opponent win the game in only one more turn.  Unfortunately, the agent doesn't know this, because it can only look one move into the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll use the **minimax algorithm** to help the agent look farther into the future and make better-informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Minimax\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to leverage information from deeper in the game tree.  For now, assume we work with a depth of 3.  This way, when deciding its move, the agent considers all possible game boards that can result from  \n",
    "1. the agent's move, \n",
    "2. the opponent's move, and \n",
    "3. the agent's next move.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with a visual example.  For simplicity, we assume that at each turn, both the agent and opponent have only two possible moves.  Each of the blue rectangles in the figure below corresponds to a different game board.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have labeled each of the \"leaf nodes\" at the bottom of the tree with the score from the heuristic.  (_We use made-up scores in the figure.  In the code, we'll use the same heuristic from the previous tutorial._)  As before, the current game board is at the top of the figure, and the agent's goal is to end up with a score that's as high as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "But notice that the agent no longer has complete control over its score -- after the agent makes its move, the opponent selects its own move.  And, the opponent's selection can prove disastrous for the agent!  In particular, \n",
    "- If the agent chooses the left branch, the opponent can force a score of -1.  \n",
    "- If the agent chooses the right branch, the opponent can force a score of +10.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Take the time now to check this in the figure, to make sure it makes sense to you!\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, you might argue that the right branch is the better choice for the agent, since it is the less risky option.  Sure, it gives up the possibility of getting the large score (+40) that can only be accessed on the left branch, but it also guarantees that the agent gets at least +10 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main idea behind the **minimax algorithm**: the agent chooses moves to get a score that is as high as possible, and it assumes the opponent will counteract this by choosing moves to force the score to be as low as possible.  That is, the agent and opponent have opposing goals, and we assume the opponent plays optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in practice, how does the agent use this assumption to select a move?  We illustrate the agent's thought process in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/bWezUC3.png\" width=90%><br/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, minimax assigns the move on the left a score of -1, and the move on the right is assigned a score of +10.  So, the agent will select the move on the right. \n",
