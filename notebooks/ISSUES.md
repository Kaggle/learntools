- Clarify separation of concerns wrt macro processing (see comment at top of `macro_processing.py`)
- Split out per-macro logic for cell-level (%%) macros
- Reimplement HIDE macros as cell-level (rather than using 'expander' $ syntax)
- Would be really nice to have some way to write 'testing' exercise notebooks (including debugging cells marked with `#%%RM_IF(PROD)%%` for testing checking code) to separate kernel ids.
