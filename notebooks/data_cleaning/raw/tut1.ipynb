It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don't have a lot of experience. For dealing with missing values, you'll need to use your intution to figure out why the value is missing. One of the most important questions you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:\n",

On the other hand, if a value is missing because it wasn't recorded, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row.
