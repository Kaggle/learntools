    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen the layers a convnet uses to extract features, it's time to put them together and build a network of your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple to Refined #\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last three lessons, we saw how convolutional networks perform **feature extraction** through three operations: **filter**, **detect**, and **condense**. A single round of feature extraction can only extract relatively simple features from an image, things like simple lines or contrasts. These are too simple to solve most classification problems. Instead, convnets will repeat this extraction over and over, so that the features become more complex and refined as they travel deeper into the network.\n",

    "# Convolutional Blocks #\n",

    "These convolutional blocks are stacks of `Conv2D` and `MaxPool2D` layers, whose role in feature extraction we learned about in the last few lessons.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each block represents a round of extraction, and by composing these blocks the convnet can combine and recombine the features produced, growing them and shaping them to better fit the problem at hand. The deep structure of modern convnets is what allows this sophisticated feature engineering and has been largely responsible for their superior performance.\n",
