    "The neural networks that are best at this task are called **convolutional neural networks** (Sometimes we say **convnet** or **CNN** instead.) Convolution is the mathematical operation that gives the layers of a convnet their unique structure. In future lessons, you'll learn why this structure is so effective at solving computer vision problems.\n",

    "We will apply these ideas to the problem of **image classification**: given a picture, can we train a computer to tell us what it's a picture *of*? You may have seen [apps](https://identify.plantnet.org/) that can identify a species of plant from a photograph. That's an image classifier! In this course, you'll learn how to build image classifiers just as powerful as those used in professional applications.\n",
    "\n",
