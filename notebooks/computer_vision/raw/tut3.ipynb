Instead, we would like to *condense* the feature map to retain only the most useful part -- the feature itself.\n",

    "We called the zero-pixels \"unimportant\". Does this mean they carry no information at all? In fact, the zero-pixels carry *positional information*. The blank space still positions the feature within the image. When `MaxPool2D` removes some of these pixels, it removes some of the positional information in the feature map. This gives a convnet a property called **translation invariance**. This means that a convnet with maximum pooling will tend not to distinguish features by their *location* in the image. (\"Translation\" is the mathematical word for changing the position of something without rotating it or changing its shape or size.)\n",

    "The two dots in the original image became indistinguishable after repeated pooling. In other words, pooling destroyed some of their positional information. Since the network can no longer distinguish between them in the feature maps, it can't distinguish them in the original image either: it has become *invariant* to that difference in position.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, pooling only creates translation invariance in a network *over small distances*, as with the two dots in the image. Features that begin far apart will remain distinct after pooling; only *some* of the positional information was lost, but not all of it.\n",

    "This invariance to small differences in the positions of features is a nice property for an image classifier to have. Just because of differences in perspective or framing, the same kind of feature might be positioned in various parts of the original image, but we would still like for the classifier to recognize that they are the same. Because this invariance is *built into* the network, we can get away with using much less data for training: we no longer have to teach it to ignore that difference. This gives convolutional networks a big efficiency advantage over a network with only dense layers. (You'll see another way to get invariance for free in **Lesson 6** with **Data Augmentation**!)\n",
