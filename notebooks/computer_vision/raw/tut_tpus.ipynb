    "In this tutorial notebook, you'll learn how to build an image classifier in Keras and train it on a [Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu). Then, in the [following exercise](#$NEXT_NOTEBOOK_URL$), you'll create your *own* notebook and make a submission to the competition. At the end, you'll have a complete project you can build off of with ideas of your own.\n",
