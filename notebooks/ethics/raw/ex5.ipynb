    "We'll continue with **Scenario B**, where you are the product manager for _Presenter Pro_.  Four more sections of the model card for _Simple Zoom_ are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factors**: The model card lists the following factors as potentially relevant to model performance: \n",
    "* Group Factors\n",
    "  * Self-reported gender\n",
    "  * Skin tone\n",
    "  * Self-reported age\n",
    "* Other Factors\n",
    "  * Camera angle\n",
    "  * Presenter distance from camera\n",
    "  * Camera type\n",
    "  * Lighting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Data**: To generate the performance metrics reported in the **Quantitative Analysis** section (discussed below), the _Simple Zoom_ team used an evaluation data set of 500 presentation videos, each between two and five minutes long. The videos included both regular and unusual presentation and recording scenarios and included presenters from various demographic backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics**: Since _Simple Zoom_ model performance is subjective (involving questions like whether a zoom is of appropriate speed or smoothness; or whether a lighting adjustment is well-executed), the _Simple Zoom_ team tested the tool’s performance by asking a diverse viewer group to view _Simple Zoom_’s output videos (using the evaluation dataset’s 500 videos as inputs). Each viewer was asked to rate the quality of video editing for each video on a scale of 1 to 10, and each video’s average rating was used as a proxy for _Simple Zoom_’s performance on that video.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative Analyses**: The quantitative analyses section of the model card includes a brief summary of performance results. According to the summary, the model generally performs equally well across all the listed demographic groups (gender, skin tone and age).\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative analyses section also includes interactive graphs, which allow you to view the performance of the _Simple Zoom_ tool by each factor and by intersections of ‘Group’ and ‘Other’ factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a member of the team evaluating _Simple Zoom_ for potential integration into _Presenter Pro_, what are some questions you might be interested in answering and exploring via the interactive graphs?"
