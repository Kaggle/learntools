    "This is only a short exercise to explore different types of fairness, and to illustrate the tradeoff that can occur when you optimize for one type of fairness over another.  We have focused on model training here, but in practice, to really mitigate bias, or to make ML systems fair, we need to take a close look at every step in the process, from data collection to releasing a final product to users. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you take a close look at the data, you'll notice that on average, individuals from Group B tend to have higher income than individuals from Group A, and are also more likely to own a home or a car.  Knowing this will prove invaluable to deciding what fairness criterion you should use, and to inform ways to achieve fairness.  (*For instance, it would likely be a bad aproach, if you did not remove the historical bias in the data and then train the model to get equal accuracy for each group.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we intentionally avoid taking an opinionated stance on how exactly to minimize bias and ensure fairness in specific projects.  This is because the correct answers continue to evolve, since AI fairness is an active area of research.  This lesson was a hands-on introduction to the topic, and you can continue your learning by reading blog posts from the [Partnership on AI](https://www.partnershiponai.org/research-lander/) or by following conferences like the [ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT)](https://facctconference.org/)."
