    "## 1. Understand people’s needs to define the problem\n",
    "Working with people to understand the pain points in their current journeys can help find unaddressed needs. This can be done by observing people as they navigate existing tools, conducting interviews, assembling focus groups, reading user feedback and other methods. Your entire team – including data scientists and engineers – should be involved in this step, so that every team member gains an understanding of the people they hope to serve. Your team should include and involve people with diverse perspectives and backgrounds, along race, gender, and other characteristics. Sharpen your problem definition and brainstorm creative and inclusive solutions together.\n",

    "> A company wants to address the problem of dosage errors for immunosuppressant drugs given to patients after liver transplants. The company starts by observing physicians, nurses and other hospital staff throughout the liver transplant process. It also interviews them about the current dosage determination process - which relies on published guidelines and human judgment - and shares video clips from the interviews with the entire development team. The company also reviews research studies and assembles focus groups of former patients and their families. All team members participate in a freewheeling brainstorming session for potential solutions.  "

    "> A disaster response agency is working with first responders to reduce the time it takes to rescue people from disasters, like floods. The time- and labor-intensive human review of drone and satellite photos to find stranded people increases rescue time. Everybody agrees that speeding up photo review would be a good outcome, since faster rescues could save more lives. The agency determines that an AI image recognition system would likely be more effective than a non-AI automated system for this task. It is also aware that AI-based image recognition tools have been applied successfully to review aerial footage in other industries, like agriculture. The agency therefore decides to further explore the possibility of an AI-based solution."

If you estimate that the harms are likely to outweigh the benefits, do not build the system.\n",

    "> An online education company wants to use an AI system to ‘read’ and automatically assign scores to student essays, while redirecting company staff to double-check random essays and to review essays that the AI system has trouble with. The system would enable the company to quickly get scores back to students. The company creates a harms review committee, which recommends that the system not be built. Some of the major harms flagged by the committee include: the potential for the AI system to pick up bias against certain patterns of language from training data and amplify it (harming people in the groups that use those patterns of language), to encourage students to ‘game’ the algorithm rather than improve their essays and to reduce the classroom role of education experts while increasing the role of technology experts."

    "> A movie streaming startup wants to use AI to recommend movies to users, based on their stated preferences and viewing history. The team first invites a diverse group of users to share their stated preferences and viewing history with a movie enthusiast, who then recommends movies that the users might like. Based on these conversations and on feedback about which recommended movies users enjoyed, the team changes its approach to how movies are categorized. Getting feedback from a diverse group of users early and iterating often allows the team to improve its product early, rather than making expensive corrections later. "
