    "`iloc` uses the Python stdlib indexing scheme, where the first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the change? Remember that loc can index any stdlib type: strings, for example. If we have a DataFrame with index values `Apples, ..., Potatoes, ...`, and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a lot more convenient to index `df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes']` than it is to index something like `df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet']` (`t` coming after `s` in the alphabet).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly confusing when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `loc`, you will need to go one lower and ask for `df.loc[0:999]`. \n",
