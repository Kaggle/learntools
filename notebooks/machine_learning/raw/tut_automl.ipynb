    "When applying machine learning to real-world data, there are a lot of steps involved in the process -- starting with collecting the data and ending with generating predictions.  (*We work with the seven steps of machine learning, as defined by Yufeng Guo **[here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-7-steps-of-machine-learning-2877d7e5548e)**.*)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/mqTCqBR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It all begins with **Step 1: Gather the data**.  In industry, there are important considerations you need to take into account when building a dataset, such as **[target leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/data-leakage)**. When participating in a Kaggle competition, this step is already completed for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **[Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)** and the **[Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)** courses, you can learn how to:\n",
    "- **Step 2: Prepare the data** - Deal with [missing values](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/missing-values) and [categorical data](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/categorical-variables).  ([Feature engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering) is covered in a separate course.)\n",
    "- **Step 4: Train the model** - Fit [decision trees](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/your-first-machine-learning-model) and [random forests](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests) to patterns in training data.\n",
    "- **Step 5: Evaluate the model** - Use a [validation set](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/model-validation) to assess how well a trained model performs on unseen data.\n",
    "- **Step 6: Tune parameters** - Tune parameters to get better performance from [XGBoost](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/xgboost) models.\n",
    "- **Step 7: Get predictions** - Generate predictions with a trained model and [submit your results to a Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/1259198).\n",
    "\n",
    "That leaves **Step 3: Select a model**.  There are _a lot_ of different types of models.  Which one should you select for your problem?  When you're just getting started, the best option is just to try everything and build your own intuition - there aren't any universally accepted rules.  There are also many useful Kaggle notebooks (like **[this one](https://www.kaggle.com/vbmokin/data-science-for-tabular-data-advanced-techniques)**) where you can see how and when other Kagglers used different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering the machine learning process involves a lot of time and practice.  While you're still learning, you can turn to **automated machine learning (AutoML) tools** to generate intelligent predictions."

In this competition, we want you to predict the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City, given the pickup and dropoff locations, number of passengers, and the pickup date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll use a **[Python class](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/automl-tables-wrapper)** that calls on AutoML Tables.  To use this code, you need only define the following variables:\n",

    "- `BUCKET_NAME` - The name of your [Google Cloud storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).  In order to work with AutoML, we'll need to create a storage bucket, where we'll upload the Kaggle dataset.\n",
    "- `DATASET_DISPLAY_NAME` - The name of your dataset.  \n",
    "- `TRAIN_FILEPATH` - The filepath for the training data (`train.csv` file) from the competition.\n",
