Pandas is the primary tool data scientists use for exploring and manipulating data.  Most people abbreviate pandas in their code as `pd`.  We do this with the command"

    "Missing values arise for many reasons. For example, the size of the 2nd bedroom wouldn't be collected when surveying a 1 bedroom house. We'll come back to the topic of missing data.\n",

    "\n",
    "To interpret the **min**, **25%**, **50%**, **75%** and **max** values, imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value.  The first (smallest) value is the min.  If you go a quarter way through the list, you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% of the values.  That is the **25%** value (pronounced \"25th percentile\").  The 50th and 75th percentiles are defined analogously, and the **max** is the largest number.\n",
