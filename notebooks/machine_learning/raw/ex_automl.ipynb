    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll use **Google Cloud AutoML Tables** to generate a submission for a Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with the **[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)** competition. The competition is simple: we want you to use 79 different explanatory variables (such as the type of roof, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms) to predict home prices.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note</b>: Google Cloud AutoML Tables is a <b>paid service</b>. At the time of publishing, it charges \\$19.32 per hour of compute during training and \\$1.16 per hour of compute for batch prediction.  You can find more details <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/pricing\"><b>here</b></a>.  \n",

    "# Set up the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we'll need to make sure that your notebook is set up to run the code.  Begin by looking at the **\"Settings\"** menu to the right of your notebook.  Your menu will look like one of the following:\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If your **\"Internet\"** setting appears as a **\"Requires phone verification\"** link, click on this link.  This will bring you to a new window; then, follow the instructions to verify your account.  After following this step, your **\"Internet\"** setting will appear **\"Off\"**, as in the example to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your **\"Internet\"** setting appears as **\"Off\"**, click to turn it on.  You'll see a pop-up window that you'll need to **\"Accept\"** in order to complete the process and have the setting switched to **\"On\"**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "We have supplied values for the following variables for you:\n",
    "- `DATASET_DISPLAY_NAME` - The name of your dataset (should use at most 32 characters; allowed characters: ASCII Latin letters A-Z and a-z, an underscore (\"\\_\"), and ASCII digits 0-9).  \n",
    "- `TRAIN_FILEPATH` - The filepath for the training data (`train.csv` file) from the competition.\n",
    "- `TEST_FILEPATH` - The filepath for the test data (`test.csv` file) from the competition.\n",
    "- `TARGET_COLUMN` - The name of the column in your training data that contains the values you'd like to predict.\n",
    "- `ID_COLUMN` - The name of the column containing IDs.\n",
    "- `MODEL_DISPLAY_NAME` - The name of your model (should use at most 32 characters; allowed characters: ASCII Latin letters A-Z and a-z, an underscore (\"\\_\"), and ASCII digits 0-9).\n",
    "- `TRAIN_BUDGET` - How long you want your model to train (use 1000 for 1 hour, 2000 for 2 hours, and so on).  In this case, since we filled in a value of 2000, the model will train for up to two hours.  **At the time of publishing, AutoML charges $19.32 for each hour of training.**  For some general guidelines about how to select this value, check out the notes on training budget at [this link](https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/docs/train).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to fill in values for:\n",
    "- `PROJECT_ID` -  The project ID you created when following the instructions to create a Google Cloud account.  \n",
    "- `BUCKET_NAME` - The name of your [Google Cloud storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).  In order to work with AutoML, we'll need to create a storage bucket, where we'll upload the Kaggle dataset.  Running the code cell will create the bucket for you.  Use these guidelines when creating a bucket name:\n",
    "  - Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (\"-\"), and underscores (\"_\"). Spaces are not allowed. \n",
    "  - Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.\n",
    "  - Bucket names must contain 3-63 characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done that, run the code cell."
