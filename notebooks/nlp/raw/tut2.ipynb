    "A common task in NLP is text classification, things like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and tagging customer queries. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to build a text classification model with SpaCy. The classifier will be trained to detect spam messages. This is a very common use and spam detectors run in the background of nearly all email clients these days."

    "As an example, let's take the sentences \"Tea is life. Tea is love.\" and \"Tea is healthy, calming, and delicious.\" as our corpus. The vocabulary then is `{\"tea\", \"is\", \"life\", \"love\", \"healthy\", \"calming\", \"and\", \"delicious\"}` (ignoring punctuation).\n",

    "For each document, we count up how many times a term occurs. We place that count in the appropriate element of a vector.

    "\n",
    "Another common representation is TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) which is similar to bag of words except that each term count is scaled by the term's frequency in the corpus. Using TF-IDF can potentially improve your models, but you won't be needing it here. Feel free to look it up though!"
