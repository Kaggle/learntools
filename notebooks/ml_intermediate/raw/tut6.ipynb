    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For much of this course, you have made predictions with the random forest method, which achieves better performance than a single decision tree simply by averaging the predictions of many decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the random forest method as an \"ensemble method\".  By definition, **ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several models (e.g., several trees, in the case of random forests).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll learn about another ensemble method called gradient boosting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient boosting** is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive.  (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we start the cycle:\n",
    "- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset.  To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.  \n",
    "- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error), for instance).\n",
    "- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble.  Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss.  (*Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.*)\n",
    "- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n",

    "`early_stopping_rounds` offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for `n_estimators`. Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for `n_estimators`.
