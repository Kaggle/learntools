For instance, when you take the [Intro to Machine Learning course](http://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning), you'll work with a Python package called \"scikit-learn\", which is a large collection of code that you'll learn how to run without reviewing all of the code in detail (as it would take too long, and you can trust that it was implemented correctly).\n",
