    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing data science, you need a way to organize your data so you can work with it efficiently.  Python has many data structures available for holding your data, such as lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to work with Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Petal to the Metal competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tpu-getting-started), your goal is to classify the species of a flower based only on its image.  (This is a common task in computer vision, and it is called image classification.)  Towards this goal, say you organize the names of the flower species in the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is by organizing the names in a Python string."
