Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science, and it's the language you'll learn in this course.  Once you complete this course, you'll be fully prepared to progress to the [Python course](http://www.kaggle.com/learn/python), followed by the [Intro to Machine Learning course](http://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning).\n",
