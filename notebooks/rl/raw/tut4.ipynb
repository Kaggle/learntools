    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our ConnectX agents have relied on detailed information about how to play the game.  The heuristic really provides a lot of guidance about how to select moves!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use **reinforcement learning** to build an intelligent agent without the use of a heuristic.  Instead, we will gradually refine the agent's strategy over time, simply by playing the game and trying to maximize the winning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we won't be able to explore this complex field in detail, but you'll learn about the big picture and explore code that you can use to train your own agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "It's difficult to come up with a perfect heuristic.  Improving the heuristic generally entails playing the game many times, to determine specific cases where the agent could have made better choices.  And, it can prove challenging to interpret what exactly is going wrong, and ultimately to fix old mistakes without accidentally introducing new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn't it be much easier if we had a more systematic way of improving the agent with gameplay experience?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, towards this goal, we'll replace the heuristic with a neural network, called a **value network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value network accepts the current board as input.  And, it outputs a probability for each possible move.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KgAliYQ.png\" width=90%><br/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the agent selects a move by sampling from these probabilities.  For instance, for the game board in the image above, the agent selects column 4 with 50% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, to encode a good gameplay strategy, we need only amend the weights of the value network so that _for every possible game board_, it assigns higher probabilities to better moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "At least in theory, that's our goal.  In practice, we won't actually check if that's the case -- since remember that Connect Four has over 4 trillion possible game boards!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we approach the task of amending the weights of the value network, in practice?  Here's the approach we'll take in this lesson:\n",
    "- After each move, we give the agent a **reward** that tells it how well it did:\n",
    "  - **_If_** the agent wins the game in that move, we give it a reward of `+1`.\n",
    "  - **_Else if_** the agent plays an invalid move (which ends the game), we give it a reward of `-10`.\n",
    "  - **_Else if_** the opponent wins the game in its next move (i.e., the agent failed to prevent its opponent from winning), we give the agent a reward of `-1`.\n",
    "  - **_Else_**, the agent gets a reward of `1/42`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- At the end of each game, the agent adds up its reward.  We refer to the sum of rewards as the agent's **cumulative reward**.  \n",
    "  - For instance, if the game lasted 8 moves (each player played four times), and the agent ultimately won, then its cumulative reward is `3*(1/42) + 1`.\n",
    "  - If the game lasted 11 moves (and the opponent went first, so the agent played five times), and the opponent won in its final move, then the agent's cumulative reward is `4*(1/42) - 1`.\n",
    "  - If the game ends in a draw, then the agent played exactly 21 moves, and it gets a reward of `21*(1/42) = 0.5`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Our goal is to find the weights of the neural network that (on average) maximize the agent's cumulative reward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the weights are set to random values.\n",
    "- As the agent plays the game, the algorithm will continually try out new values for the weights, to see how the cumulative reward is affected, on average.  Over time, after playing many games, we get a better idea of how the weights affect cumulative reward, the algorithm settles towards weights that performed better.  \n",
    "    - _Of course, we have glossed over the details here, and there's a lot of complexity involved in this process.  For now, we focus on the big picture!_\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- This way, we'll end up with an agent that tries to win the game (so it gets the final reward of `+1`) and tries to make the game last as long as possible (so that it collects the `1/42` bonus as many times as it can).\n",
    "    - _You might argue that it doesn't really make sense to want the game to last as long as possible -- this might result in a very inefficient agent that doesn't play obvious winning moves early in gameplay.  And, your intuition would be correct -- this will make the agent less efficient!  The reason we include the `1/42` bonus is to help the algorithms we'll use to converge better.  Further discussion is outside of the scope of this course, but you can learn more by reading about the \"temporal credit assignment problem\" and \"reward shaping\"._\n",
    "    \n",
    "tthis is one way we can ttry to offer a solution tto connectx with rl\n",
    "in general, reinforcement learning can be applied to many different problem areas; this same idea of giving an agent a reward after each action it selects yields broad framework that can be applied to robotics, inventory . management, smong otthers\n",
    "in general, plagued by instability, oftten doesn't perform well\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of great implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms online.  In this course, we'll use [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Stable Baselines is not yet compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.  So, we begin by downgrading to TensorFlow 1.0."
