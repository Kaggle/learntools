    "# Recap\n",
    "We started by learning about permutation importance and partial dependence plots for an overview of what the model has learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then learned about SHAP values to break down the components of individual predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll expand on SHAP values, seeing how aggregating many SHAP values can give more detailed alternatives to permutation importance and partial dependence plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SHAP Values Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Shap values show how much a given feature changed our prediction (compared to if we made that prediction at some baseline value of that feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider an ultra-simple model:\n",
    "    $$y = 4 * x1 + 2 * x2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x1$ takes the value 2, instead of a baseline value of 0, then our SHAP value for $x1$ would be 8 (from 4 times 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are harder to calculate with the sophisticated models we use in practice. But through some algorithmic cleverness, Shap values allow us to decompose any prediction into the sum of effects of each feature value, yielding a graph like this:\n",

    "[Link to larger view](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/JVD2U7k.png)*\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this nice breakdown for each prediction, the [Shap library](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) offers great visualizations of groups of Shap values. We will focus on two of these visualizations. These visualizations have conceptual similarities to permutation importance and partial dependence plots. So multiple threads from the previous exercises will come together here.\n",

    "# Summary Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "[Permutation importance](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/permutation-importance) is great because it created simple numeric measures to see which features mattered to a model. This helped us make comparisons between features easily, and you can present the resulting graphs to non-technical audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it doesn't tell you how each features matter. If a feature has medium permutation importance, that could mean it has\n",
    "- a large effect for a few predictions, but no effect in general, or\n",
    "- a medium effect for all predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP summary plots give us a birds-eye view of feature importance and what is driving it. We'll walk through an example plot for the soccer data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/Ew9X3su.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot is made of many dots. Each dot has three characteristics:\n",
    "- Vertical location shows what feature it is depicting\n",
    "- Color shows whether that feature was high or low for that row of the dataset\n",
    "- Horizontal location shows whether the effect of that value caused a higher or lower prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the point in the upper left was for a team that scored few goals, reducing the prediction by 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things you should be able to easily pick out:\n",
    "- The model ignored the `Red` and `Yellow & Red` features. \n",
    "- Usually `Yellow Card` doesn't affect the prediction, but there is an extreme case where a high value caused a much lower prediction.\n",
    "- High values of Goal scored caused higher predictions, and low values caused low predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look for long enough, there's a lot of information in this graph. You'll face some questions to test how you read them in the exercise.\n",
