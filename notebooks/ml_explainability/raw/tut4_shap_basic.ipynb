    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen (and used) techniques to extract general insights from a machine learning model. But what if you want to break down how the model works for an individual prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP Values (an acronym from SHapley Additive exPlanations) break down a prediction to show the impact of each feature. Where could you use this?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A model says a bank shouldn't loan someone money, and the bank is legally required to explain the basis for each loan rejection\n",
    "- A healthcare provider wants to identify what factors are driving each patient's risk of some disease so they can directly address those risk factors with targeted health interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use SHAP Values to explain individual predictions in this lesson. In the next lesson, you'll see how these can be aggregated into powerful model-level insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How They Work\n",
    "SHAP values interpret the impact of having a certain value for a given feature in comparison to the prediction we'd make if that feature took some baseline value.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is helpful, and we'll continue the soccer/football example from the [permutation importance](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/permutation-importance) and [partial dependence plots](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/partial-plots) lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In these tutorials, we predicted whether a team would have a player win the *Man of the Match* award.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could ask:\n",
    "- How much was a prediction driven by the fact that the team scored 3 goals?\n",
    "    \n",
    "But it's easier to give a concrete, numeric answer if we restate this as:\n",
    "- How much was a prediction driven by the fact that the team scored 3 goals, **instead of some baseline number of goals.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, each team has many features. So if we answer this question for `number of goals`, we could repeat the process for all other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP values do this in a way that guarantees a nice property. Specifically, you decompose a prediction with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sum(SHAP values for all features) = pred_for_team - pred_for_baseline_values```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the SHAP values of all features sum up to explain why my prediction was different from the baseline. This allows us to decompose a prediction in a graph like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/JVD2U7k.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "How do you interpret this?\n",
    "\n",
    "We predicted 0.7, whereas the base_value is 0.4979.  Feature values causing increased predictions are in pink, and their visual size shows the magnitude of the feature's effect.  Feature values decreasing the prediction are in blue.  The biggest impact comes from `Goal Scored` being 2.  Though the ball possession value has a meaningful effect decreasing the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you subtract the length of the blue bars from the length of the pink bars, it equals the distance from the base value to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some complexity to the technique, to ensure that the baseline plus the sum of individual effects adds up to the prediction (which isn't as straightforward as it sounds). We won't go into that detail here, since it isn't critical for using the technique. [This blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/one-feature-attribution-method-to-supposedly-rule-them-all-shapley-values-f3e04534983d) has a longer theoretical explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code to Calculate SHAP Values\n",
    "We calculate SHAP values using the wonderful [Shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we'll reuse the model you've already seen with the Soccer data."
