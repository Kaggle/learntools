    "The majority of the heavy lifting done by PyMC3 is taken care of with the `theano` package. The notation in `theano` is remarkably similar to NumPy. It also supports many of the familiar computational elements of NumPy. However, while NumPy directly executes computations, e.g. when you run `a + b`, `theano` instead builds up a \"compute graph\" that tracks that you want to perform the `+` operation on the elements `a` and `b`. Only when you `eval()` a `theano` expression does the computation take place (i.e. `theano` is lazy evaluated). Once the compute graph is built, we can perform all kinds of mathematical optimizations (e.g. simplifications), compute gradients via autodiff, compile the entire graph to C to run at machine speed, and also compile it to run on the GPU. PyMC3 is basically a collection of `theano` symbolic expressions for various probability distributions that are combined to one big compute graph making up the whole model log probability, and a collection of inference algorithms that use that graph to compute probabilities and gradients. For practical purposes, what this means is that in order to build certain models we sometimes have to use `theano`.\n",

No. At this point, we could continue and assign a distribution to $\\alpha$, but it's better to stop once we reach a set level of ignorance: whereas we have a prior belief about $\\lambda$, (\"it probably changes over time\", \"it's likely between 10 and 30\", etc.), we don't really have any strong beliefs about $\\alpha$. So it's best to stop here. \n",

We think that the $\\lambda$s are between 10-30, so if we set $\\alpha$ really low (which corresponds to larger probability on high values) we are not reflecting our prior well. Similar, a too-high alpha misses our prior belief as well. A good idea for $\\alpha$ as to reflect our belief is to set the value so that the mean of $\\lambda$, given $\\alpha$, is equal to our observed mean. This was shown in the last chapter.\n",

    "##### Example: Bayesian A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is a statistical design pattern for determining the difference of effectiveness between two different treatments. For example, a pharmaceutical company is interested in the effectiveness of drug A vs drug B. The company will test drug A on some fraction of their trials, and drug B on the other fraction (this fraction is often 1/2, but we will relax this assumption). After performing enough trials, the in-house statisticians sift through the data to determine which drug yielded better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, front-end web developers are interested in which design of their website yields more sales or some other metric of interest. They will route some fraction of visitors to site A, and the other fraction to site B, and record if the visit yielded a sale or not. The data is recorded (in real-time), and analyzed afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the post-experiment analysis is done using something called a hypothesis test like *difference of means test* or *difference of proportions test*. This involves often misunderstood quantities like a \"Z-score\" and even more confusing \"p-values\" (please don't ask). If you have taken a statistics course, you have probably been taught this technique (though not necessarily *learned* this technique). And if you were like me, you may have felt uncomfortable with their derivation -- good: the Bayesian approach to this problem is much more natural. \n",

    "### A Simple Case\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a hacker book, we'll continue with the web-dev example. For the moment, we will focus on the analysis of site A only. Assume that there is some true $0 \\lt p_A \\lt 1$ probability that users who, upon shown site A, eventually purchase from the site. This is the true effectiveness of site A. Currently, this quantity is unknown to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose site A was shown to $N$ people, and $n$ people purchased from the site. One might conclude hastily that $p_A = \\frac{n}{N}$. Unfortunately, the *observed frequency* $\\frac{n}{N}$ does not necessarily equal $p_A$ -- there is a difference between the *observed frequency* and the *true frequency* of an event. The true frequency can be interpreted as the probability of an event occurring. For example, the true frequency of rolling a 1 on a 6-sided die is $\\frac{1}{6}$. Knowing the true frequency of events like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- fraction of users who make purchases, \n",
    "- frequency of social attributes, \n",
    "- percent of internet users with cats etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "are common requests we ask of Nature. Unfortunately, often Nature hides the true frequency from us and we must *infer* it from observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *observed frequency* is then the frequency we observe: say rolling the die 100 times you may observe 20 rolls of 1. The observed frequency, 0.2, differs from the true frequency, $\\frac{1}{6}$. We can use Bayesian statistics to infer probable values of the true frequency using an appropriate prior and observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to our A/B example, we are interested in using what we know, $N$ (the total trials administered) and $n$ (the number of conversions), to estimate what $p_A$, the true frequency of buyers, might be. \n",

    "To setup a Bayesian model, we need to assign prior distributions to our unknown quantities. *A priori*, what do we think $p_A$ might be? For this example, we have no strong conviction about $p_A$, so for now, let's assume $p_A$ is uniform over [0,1]:"

One could of course argue that the interviewers are still receiving false data since some *Yes*'s are not confessions but instead randomness, but an alternative perspective is that the researchers are discarding approximately half of their original dataset since half of the responses will be noise. But they have gained a systematic data generation process that can be modeled. Furthermore, they do not have to incorporate (perhaps somewhat naively) the possibility of deceitful answers.

Of the previous 24 flights, data were available on failures of O-rings on 23, (one was lost at sea), and these data were discussed on the evening preceding the Challenger launch, but unfortunately only the data corresponding to the 7 flights on which there was a damage incident were considered important and these were thought to show no obvious trend.
