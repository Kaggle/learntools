    "# What is Data Leakage\n",
    "Data leakage is one of the most important issues for a data scientist to understand. If you don't know how to prevent it, leakage will come up frequently, and it will ruin your models in the most subtle and dangerous ways.  Specifically, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate. This tutorial will show you what leakage is and how to avoid it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of leakage: **Leaky Predictors** and a **Leaky Validation Strategies.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leaky Predictors\n",
    "This occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| got_pneumonia | age | weight |  male | took_antibiotic_medicine | ... |\n",
    "|:-------------:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|:------------------------:|-----|\n",
    "|     False     |  65 |   100  | False |           False          | ... |\n",
    "|     False     |  72 |   130  |  True |           False          | ... |\n",
    "|      True     |  58 |   100  | False |           True           | ... |\n",
    "-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "People take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. So the raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns. But *took_antibiotic_medicine* is frequently changed **after** the value for *got_pneumonia* is determined. This is target leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model would see that anyone who has a value of `False` for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia.  Validation data comes from the same source, so the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores. But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded. Because when we use this model to make new predictions, that data won't be available to the model.\n",

    "## Leaky Validation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A much different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful distinguishing training data from validation data.  For example, this happens if you run preprocessing (like fitting the Imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split.  Validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data it hasn't considered before.  You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavoir..  The end result?  Your model will get very good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preventing Leaky Predictors\n",
    "There is no single solution that universally prevents leaky predictors. It requires knowledge about your data, case-specific inspection and common sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, leaky predictors frequently have high statistical correlations to the target.  So two tactics to keep in mind:\n",
    "* To screen for possible leaky predictors, look for columns that are statistically correlated to your target.\n",
    "* If you build a model and find it extremely accurate, you likely have a leakage problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preventing Leaky Validation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "If your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of *fitting*, including the fitting of preprocessing steps.  This is easier if you use [scikit-learn Pipelines](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/pipelines).  When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you use pipelines and do your preprocessing inside the pipeline.\n",

    " - **expenditure:** Average monthly credit card expenditure\n",

    "This accuracy is quite a bit lower, which on the one hand is disappointing.

    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Data leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data is a first step, and pipelines can help implement this separation.  Leaking predictors are a more frequent issue, and leaking predictors are harder to track down. A combination of caution, common sense and data exploration can help identify leaking predictors so you remove them from your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise\n",
    "Review the data in your ongoing project.  Are there any predictors that may cause leakage?  As a hint, most datasets from Kaggle competitions don't have these variables. Once you get past those carefully curated datasets, this becomes a common issue.\n",
