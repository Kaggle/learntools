    "# What Are Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data processing and modeling code organized.  Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but Pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "1. **Cleaner Code:** You won't need to keep track of your training (and validation) data at each step of processing.  Accounting for data at each step of processing can get messy.  With a pipeline, you don't need to manually keep track of each step.\n",
    "2. **Fewer Bugs:** There are fewer opportunities to mis-apply a step or forget a pre-processing step.\n",
    "3. **Easier to Productionize:** It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale.  We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "4. **More Options For Model Testing:** You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n",

    "# Understanding Pipelines\n",
    "Most scikit-learn objects are either **transformers** or **models.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformers** are for pre-processing before modeling.  The Imputer class (for filling in missing values) is an example of a transformer.  Over time, you will learn many more transformers, and you will frequently use multiple transformers sequentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Models** are used to make predictions. You will usually preprocess your data (with transformers) before putting it in a model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell if an object is a transformer or a model by how you apply it.  After fitting a transformer, you apply it with the *transform* command.  After fitting a model, you apply it with the *predict* command. Your pipeline must start with transformer steps and end with a model.  This is what you'd want anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually you will want to apply more transformers and combine them more flexibly.  We will cover this later in an Advanced Pipelines tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your Turn\n",
    "Take your modeling code and convert it to use pipelines.  For now, you'll need to do one-hot encoding of categorical variables outside of the pipeline (i.e. before putting the data in the pipeline)."
