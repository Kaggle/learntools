    "In this lesson we're going to see how we can build neural networks capable of learning the complex kinds of relationships deep neural nets are famous for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is *modularity*, building up a complex network from simpler functional units. We've seen how a linear unit computes a linear function -- now we'll see how to combine and modify these single units to model more complex relationships.\n",

    "# Layers #\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks typically organize their neurons into **layers**. When we collect together linear units having a common set of inputs we get a **dense** layer.\n",

    "You could think of each layer in a neural network as performing some kind of relatively simple transformation. Through a deep stack of layers, a neural network can transform its inputs in more and more complex ways. In a well-trained neural network, each layer is a transformation getting us a little bit closer to a solution.\n",

    "    <strong>Many Kinds of Layers</strong><br>\n",
    "A \"layer\" in Keras is a very general kind of thing. A layer can be, essentially, any kind of <em>data transformation</em>. Many layers, like the <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D\">convolutional</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/RNN\">recurrent</a> layers, transform data through use of neurons and differ primarily in the pattern of connections they form. Others though are used for <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding\">feature engineering</a> or just <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Add\">simple arithmetic</a>. There's a whole world of layers to discover -- <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers\">check them out</a>!\n",

    "It turns out, however, that two dense layers with nothing in between are no better than a single dense layer by itself. Dense layers by themselves can never move us out of the world of lines and planes. What we need is something *nonlinear*. What we need are activation functions.\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "An **activation function** is simply some function we apply to each of a layer's outputs (its *activations*). The most common is the *rectifier* function $max(0, x)$.\n",

    "The rectifier function has a graph that's a line with the negative part \"rectified\" to zero. Applying the function to the outputs of a neuron will put a *bend* in the data, moving us away from simple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we attach the rectifier to a linear unit, we get a **rectified linear unit** or **ReLU**. (For this reason, it's common to call the rectifier function the \"ReLU function\".)  Applying a ReLU activation to a linear unit means the output becomes `max(0, w * x + b)`, which we might draw in a diagram like:\n",
