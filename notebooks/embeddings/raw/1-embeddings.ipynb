    "By this I mean a categorical variable with lots of possible values (high *cardinality*), with a small number of them (often just 1) present in any given observation. One good example is words. There are hundreds of thousands of them in the English language, but a single tweet might only have a dozen. Word embeddings are a crucial technique for applying deep learning to natural language. But other examples abound.\n",

Good luck fitting that all into memory at once!\n",

You can think of it as a sort of 'lookup table'. This is much more efficient than taking a one-hot vector and doing a huge matrix multiplication!\n",

It's up to the model to discover whatever properties of the entities are useful for the prediction task, and encode them in the embedding space. Sound mysterious? In later lessons I'll show some techniques for interpreting learned embeddings, such as visualizing them with the t-SNE algorithm."
