What's the length of the vector `(3, 4)`? Well, if we start at `(0, 0)`, walk 3 steps to the right, and then 4 steps up, we'll get a right triangle where the hypotenuse connects `(3, 4)` to `(0, 0)`. By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of that hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$. We can extend the calculation to any number of dimensions - for example, the L2 norm of the vector `(1, 1, 3, 5)` is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2} = 6$.\n",
