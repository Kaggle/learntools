    "- How do purple martins, a threatened bird species, travel between North and South America?  Are the birds travelling to conservation areas?\n",
    "- Which areas of Japan could potentially benefit from extra earthquake reinforcement?\n",
    "- Which Starbucks stores in California are strong candidates for the next [Starbucks Reserve Roastery](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystern/2019/01/22/starbucks-reserve-roastery-its-spacious-and-trendy-but-why-is-starbucks-slowing-down-expansion/#6cb80d4a1bc6) location?\n",
