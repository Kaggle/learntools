    "You are a bird conservation expert and want to understand migration patterns of purple martins.  In your research, you discover that these birds typically spend the summer breeding season in the eastern United States, and then migrate to South America for the winter.  But since this bird is under threat of endangerment, you'd like to take a closer look at the locations that these birds are more likely to visit.\n",

    "There are several [protected areas](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about) in South America, which operate under special regulations to ensure that species that migrate (or live) there have the best opportunity to thrive.  You'd like to know if purple martins tend to visit these areas.  To answer this question, you'll use some recently collected [Global Positioning System (GPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) data that tracks the year-round location of eleven different birds.\n",
