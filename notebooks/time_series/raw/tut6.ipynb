    "# Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lessons 2 and 3, we treated forecasting as a simple regression problem with all of our features derived from a single input, the time index. We could easily create forecasts for any time in the future by just generating our desired trend and seasonal features.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we added lag features in Lesson 4, however, the nature of the problem changed. Lag features require that the lagged target value is known at the time being forecast. A lag 1 feature shifts the time series forward 1 step, which means you could forecast 1 step into the future but not 2 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 4, we just assumed that we could always generate lags up to the period we wanted to forecast (every prediction was for just one step forward, in other words). Real-world forecasting typically demands more than this, so in this lesson we'll learn how to make forecasts for a variety of situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Defining the Forecasting Task #\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things to establish before designing a forecasting model:\n",
    "- what information is available at the time a forecast is made (features), and,\n",
    "- the time period during which you require forecasted values (target).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **forecast origin** is time at which you are making a forecast. Practically, you might consider the forecast origin to be the last time for which you have training data for the time being predicted. Everything up to he origin can be used to create features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **forecast horizon** is the time for which you are making a forecast. We often describe a forecast by the number of time steps in its horizon: a \"1-step\" forecast or \"5-step\" forecast, say. The forecast horizon describes the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>A three-step forecast horizon with a two-step lead time, using four lag features. The figure represents what would be a single row of training data -- data for a single prediction, in other words.\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The time between the origin and the horizon is the **lead time** (or sometimes *latency*) of the forecast. A forecast's lead time is described by the number of steps from origin to horizon: a \"1-step ahead\" or \"3-step ahead\" forecast, say. In practice, it may be necessary for a forecast to begin multiple steps ahead of the origin because of delays in data acquisition or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preparing Data for Forecasting #\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to forecast time series with ML algorithms, we need to transform the series into a dataframe we can use with those algorithms. (Unless, of course, you are only using deterministic features like trend and seasonality.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw the first half of this process in Lesson 4 when we created a feature set out of lags. The second half is preparing the target. How we do this depends on the forecasting task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in a dataframe represents a single forecast. The time index of the row is the first time in the forecast horizon, but we arrange values for the entire horizon in the same row. For multistep forecasts, this means we are requiring a model to produce multiple outputs, one for each step."

    "### Multioutput model\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a model that produces multiple outputs naturally. Linear regression and neural networks can both produce multiple outputs. This strategy is simple and efficient, but not possible for every algorithm you might want to use. XGBoost can't do this, for instance.\n",
    "\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a separate model for each step in the horizon: one model forecasts 1-step ahead, another 2-steps ahead, and so on. Forecasting 1-step ahead is a different problem than 2-steps ahead (and so on), so it can help to have a different model make forecasts for each step. The downside is that training lots of models can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"padding: 1em;\">\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"textalign: center; font-style: italic\"><center>\n",
    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a single one-step model and use its forecasts to update the lag features for the next step. With the recursive method, we feed a model's 1-step forecast back in to that same model to use as a lag feature for the next forecasting step. We only need to train one model, but since errors will propagate from step to step, forecasts can be inaccurate for long horizons.\n",
    "\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### DirRec strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of the direct and recursive strategies: train a model for each step and use forecasts from previous steps as *new* lag features. Step by step, each model gets an additional lag input. Since each model always has an up-to-date set of lag features, the DirRec strategy can capture serial dependence better than Direct, but it can also suffer from error propagation like Recursive.\n",

    "In this example we'll apply the MultiOutput and Direct strategies to the *Flu Trends* data from Lesson 4, this time making true forecasts for multiple weeks beyond the training period.\n",
    "\n",
