    "# What is Seasonality? #\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a time series exhibits **seasonality** whenever there is a regular, periodic change in the mean of the series. Seasonal changes generally follow the clock and calendar -- repetitions over a day, a week, or a year are common. Seasonality is often driven by the cycles of the natural world over days and years or by conventions of social behavior surrounding dates and times.\n",

    "</center></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn two kinds of features that model seasonality. The first kind, indicators, is best for a season with few observations, like a weekly season of daily observations. The second kind, Fourier features, is best for a season with many observations, like an annual season of daily observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Seasonal Plots and Seasonal Indicators #\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we used a moving average plot to discover the trend in a series, we can use a **seasonal plot** to discover seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A seasonal plot shows segments of the time series plotted against some common period, the period being the \"season\" you want to observe. The figure shows a seasonal plot of the daily views of Wikipedia's article on *Trigonometry*: the article's daily views plotted over a common *weekly* period.\n",

    "### Seasonal indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonal indicators** are binary features that represent seasonal differences in the level of a time series. Seasonal indicators are what you get if you treat a seasonal period as a categorical feature and apply one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "By one-hot encoding days of the week, we get weekly seasonal indicators. Creating weekly indicators for the *Trigonometry* series will then give us six new \"dummy\" features. (Linear regression works best if you drop one of the indicators; we chose Monday in the frame below.)\n",

The idea is to include in our training data periodic curves having the same frequencies as the season we are trying to model. The curves we use are those of the trigonometric functions sine and cosine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fourier features** are pairs of sine and cosine curves, one pair for each potential frequency in the season starting with the longest. Fourier pairs modeling annual seasonality would have frequencies: once per year, twice per year, three times per year, and so on.\n",

    "Notice that we only needed eight features (four sine / cosine pairs) to get a good estimate of the annual seasonality. Compare this to the seasonal indicator method which would have required hundreds of features (one for each day of the year). By modeling only the \"main effect\" of the seasonality with Fourier features, you'll usually need to add far fewer features to your training data, which means reduced computation time and less risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Fourier features with the Periodogram\n",
    "\n",
    "How many Fourier pairs should we actually include in our feature set? We can answer this question with the periodogram. The **periodogram** tells you the strength of the frequencies in a time series. Specifically, the value on the y-axis of the graph is `(a ** 2 + b ** 2) / 2`, where `a` and `b` are the coefficients of the sine and cosine at that frequency (as in the *Fourier Components* plot above).\n",
