    "\n",
    "The **trend** component of a time series represents a persistent, long-term change in the mean of the series. The trend is the slowest-moving part of a series, the part representing the largest time scale of importance. In a time series of product sales, an increasing trend might be the effect of a market expansion as more people become aware of the product year by year.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll focus on trends in the mean. More generally though, any persistent and slow-moving change in a series could constitute a trend -- time series commonly have trends in their variation for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Moving Average Plots #\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what kind of trend a time series might have, we can use a **moving average plot**. To compute a moving average of a time series, we compute the average of the values within a sliding window of some defined width. Each point on the graph represents the average of all the values in the series that fall within the window on either side. The idea is to smooth out any short-term fluctuations in the series so that only long-term changes remain.\n",

    "Notice how the *Mauna Loa* series above has a repeating up and down movement year after year -- a short-term, *seasonal* change. For a change to be a part of the trend, it should occur over a longer period than any seasonal changes. To visualize a trend, therefore, we take an average over a period longer than any seasonal period in the series. For the *Mauna Loa* series, we chose a window of size 12 to smooth over the season within each year."
