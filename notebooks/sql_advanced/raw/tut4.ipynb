    "Sometimes it doesn't matter whether your query is efficient or not. For example, you might write a query you expect to run only once, and it might be working on a small dataset. In this case, anything that gives you the answer you need will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about queries that will be run many times, like a query that feeds data to a website? Those need to be efficient so you don't leave users waiting for your website to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or what about queries on huge datasets? These can be slow and cost a business a lot of money if they are written poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most database systems have a **query optimizer** that attempts to interpret/execute your query in the most effective way possible. But several strategies can still yield huge savings in many cases.\n",

    "# Some useful functions\n",

    "We will use two functions to compare the efficiency of different queries:\n",
