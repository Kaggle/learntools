    "In this hands-on micro-course, you'll learn how to take your data visualizations to the next level through the use of [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html), a powerful but easy-to-use data visualization library.  To take a peek at some of the charts you'll make in this micro-course, check out the figures below!\n",

    "To use seaborn, you'll also learn a bit about how to write code in Python, a popular programming language.  That said,\n",
    "- **the micro-course is aimed at those with no prior programming experience**, and\n",
    "- each chart uses short and simple code, making seaborn much faster and easier to use than many other data visualization tools (_such as Excel, for instance_).  \n",
