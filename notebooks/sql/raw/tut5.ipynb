    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that you've learned, your SQL queries are getting pretty long, which can make them hard understand (and debug).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are about to learn how to use **AS** and **WITH** to tidy up your queries and make them easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll use the familiar `pets` table, but now it includes the ages of the animals. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/MXrsiAZ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# AS\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned in an earlier tutorial how to use **AS** to rename the columns generated by your queries, which is also known as **aliasing**.  This is similar to how Python uses `as` for aliasing when doing imports like `import pandas as pd` or `import seaborn as sns`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To use **AS** in SQL, insert it right after the column you select.  Here's an example of a query _without_ an **AS** clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/VelX9tP.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's an example of the same query, but _with_ **AS**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/teF84tU.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These queries return the same information, but in the second query the column returned by the **COUNT()** function will be called `Number`, rather than the default name of `f0__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# WITH ... AS\n",
    "\n",
    "On its own, **AS** is a convenient way to clean up the data returned by your query. It's even more powerful when combined with **WITH** in what's called a \"common table expression\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A **common table expression** (or **CTE**) is a temporary table that you return within your query. CTEs are helpful for splitting your queries into readable chunks, and you can write queries against them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you might want to use the `pets` table to ask questions about older animals in particular.  So you can start by creating a CTE which only contains information about animals more than five years old like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/0Kz8q4x.png)\n",
    "            \n",
    "While this incomplete query above won't return anything, it creates a CTE that we can then refer to (as `Seniors`) while writing the rest of the query.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can finish the query by pulling the information that we want from the CTE.  The complete query below first creates the CTE, and then returns all of the IDs from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/3xQZM4p.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "You could do this without a CTE, but if this were the first part of a very long query, removing the CTE would make it much harder to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it's important to note that CTEs only exist inside the query where you create them, and you can't reference them in later queries.  So, any query that uses a CTE is always broken into two parts: (1) first, we create the CTE, and then (2) we write a query that uses the CTE."
