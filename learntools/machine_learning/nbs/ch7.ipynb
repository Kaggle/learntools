Look at the list of columns and think about what might affect home prices.  Some predictors will cause errors because of issues like missing values or non-numeric data types. Keep going to Level 2 of the Machine Learning Course to learn how to include these types of predictors. This course will also teach you **xgboost**, a technique giving even better accuracy than Random Forest.\n",
