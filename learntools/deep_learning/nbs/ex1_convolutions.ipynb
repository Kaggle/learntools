    "To build and test your intuition for convolutions, you will design a vertical line detector.  We'll apply it to each part of an image to create a new tensor showing where there are vertical lines.\n",

    "Follow these following 4 steps:\n",
    "1. **Fork this notebook**\n",
    "2. **Run this full notebook and scroll down to see the output**  You will see the original image, as well as an example of the image we get from applying our horizontal line detector to the image.\n",
    "3. **Fill in the code cell for `vertical_line_conv`.**  You will have to think about what numbers in the list will create a vertical line detector.  Run this cell.\n",
    "4. **Add `vertical_line_conv` to `conv_list`.  Run that cell.**  You will see the output of your vertical line filter underneath the horizontal line filter.  You will also see a printed hint indicating if you got this right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once that's done, you are ready to learn about deep convolutional models, the key to modern computer vision breakthroughs.\n",
