    "The cameraman who shot our deep learning videos mentioned a problem that we can solve with deep learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "He offers a service that scans photographs to store them digitally.  He uses a machine that quickly scans many photos. But depending on the orientation of the original photo, many images are digitized sideways.  He fixes these manually, looking at each photo to determine which ones to rotate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will build a model that distinguishes which photos are sideways and which are upright, so an app could automatically rotate each image if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were going to sell this service commercially, you might use a large dataset to train the model. But you'll have great success with even a small dataset.  You'll work with a small dataset of dog pictures, half of which are rotated sideways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying and compiling the model look the same as in the example you've seen. But you'll need to make some changes to fit the model.\n",
