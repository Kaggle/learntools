By now, you have the tools to get many different configurations of information from a single table. But what if your database has more than one table and you want to look at information from multiple tables?\n\nThat's where JOIN comes in! Today, we're going to learn about how to use JOIN to combine data from two tables. This will let us answer more types of questions. It's also one of the more complex parts of SQL. Don't worry, though, we're going to go through some examples together. \n\n### JOIN\n___\n\nLet's keep working with our imaginary Pets dataset, but this time let's add a second table. The first table, \"Pets\", has three columns, with information on the ID number of each pet, the pet's name and the type of animal it is. The new table, \"Owners\", has three columns, with the ID number of each owner, the name of the owner and the ID number of their pet. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/W4gYoNg.png)\n\nEach row in each table is associated with a single pet and we refer to the same pets in both tables. We can tell this because there are two columns (ID in the \"Pets\" table and Pet_ID in the \"Owners\" table) that have the same information in them: the ID number of the pet. We can match rows that have the same value in these columns to get information that applies to a certain pet.\n\nFor example, we can see by looking at the Pets table that the pet that has the ID 1 is named Dr. Harris Bonkers. We can also tell by looking at the Owners table that the name of the owner who owns the pet with the ID 1 is named Aubrey Little. We can use this information to figure out that Dr. Harris Bonkers is owned by Aubrey Little. \n\nFortunately, we don't have to do this by hand to figure out which owner's name goes with which pet name. We can use JOIN to do this for us! JOIN allows us to create a third, new, table that has information from both tables. For example, we might want to have a single table with just two columns: one with the name of the pet and one with the name of the owner. This would look something like this: \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zqQdJTI.png)\n\nThe syntax to create that table looks like this:\n\n    SELECT p.Name AS Pet_Name, o.Name as Owner_Name\n    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` as p\n    INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.owners` as o ON p.ID = o.Pet_ID\nNotice that since the ID column exists in both datasets, we have to clarify which one we want to use. When you're joining tables, it's a good habit to specificy which table all of your columns come from. That way you don't have to pull up the schema every time you go back to read the query.\n\nThe type of JOIN we're using today is called an INNER JOIN. That just means that a row will only be put in the final output table if the value in the column you're using to combine them shows up in both the tables you're joining. For example, if Tom's ID code of 4 didn't exist in the `Pets` table, we would only get 3 rows back from this query. There are other types of JOIN, but an INNER JOIN won't give you an output that's larger than your input tables, so it's a good one to start with.   \n\n> **What does \"ON\" do?** It says which column in each table to look at to combine the tables. Here were using the \"ID\" column from the Pets table and the \"Pet_ID\" table from the Owners table.\n\nNow that we've talked about the concept behind using JOIN, let's work through an example together."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Example: How many files are covered by each license?\n____\n\nToday we're going to be using the GitHub Repos dataset. GitHub is an place for people to store & collaborate on different versions of their computer code. A \"repo\" is a collection of code associated with a specific project. \n\nMost public code on Github is shared under a specific license, which determines how it can be used and by who.

This one is going to be a bit of a beast, so stick with me! The only new syntax we'll see is around the JOIN clause, everything is something we've already learned. :)\n\nFirst, I'm going to specify which columns I'd like to be returned in the final table that's returned to me. Here, I'm selecting the COUNT of the \"path\" column from the sample_files table and then calling it \"number_of_files\".
